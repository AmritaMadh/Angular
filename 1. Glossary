Compiler
  1. Just in Time
     - The Angular just-in-time (JIT) compiler converts your Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code at run time,
       as part of bootstrapping.
     - JIT compilation is the default when you run Angular's ng build and ng serve CLI commands, and is a good choice during development.
     - JIT mode is strongly discouraged for production use because it results in large application payloads that hinder the bootstrap performance.
 
 2. Ahead of Time
     - The Angular ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler converts Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code during the build 
       phase, before the browser downloads and runs that code. 
     - This is the best compilation mode for production environments, with decreased load time and increased performance compared to 
       just-in-time (JIT) compilation.
     - By compiling your application using the ngc command-line tool, you can bootstrap directly to a module factory, so you don't need to
       include the Angular compiler in your JavaScript bundle.
