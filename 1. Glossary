Compiler
  1. Just in Time
     - The Angular just-in-time (JIT) compiler converts your Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code at run time,
       as part of bootstrapping.
     - JIT compilation is the default when you run Angular's ng build and ng serve CLI commands, and is a good choice during development.
     - JIT mode is strongly discouraged for production use because it results in large application payloads that hinder the bootstrap performance.
 
 2. Ahead of Time
     - The Angular ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler converts Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code during the build 
       phase, before the browser downloads and runs that code. 
     - This is the best compilation mode for production environments, with decreased load time and increased performance compared to 
       just-in-time (JIT) compilation.
     - By compiling your application using the ngc command-line tool, you can bootstrap directly to a module factory, so you don't need to
       include the Angular compiler in your JavaScript bundle.
       
3. class decorator
     - A decorator that appears immediately before a class definition, which declares the class to be of the given type, and provides metadata suitable to the type.
       The following decorators can declare Angular class types:
       @Component()
       @Directive()
       @Pipe()
       @Injectable()
       @NgModule()
       
     - class field decorator
       A decorator statement immediately before a field in a class definition that declares the type of that field. Some examples are 
       @Input and 
       @Output.
