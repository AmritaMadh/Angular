   - Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular apps depend on features and functionality provided by libraries that are available as npm packages

Step 1 : Install Angular CLI globally using npm
         We use angular CLI to create projects, generate application and library code and perform varity of on going development taks 
         such as testing, building and deployment.
         npm install -g @angular/cli
         
Step 2: Create a workspace and initial application
        Run CLI command ng new my-app
        Angular CLI install necessary npm packages and otherdependencies
        
Step 3: Run the application
        Angular CLU includes SERVER so that we can easily build and serve our application locally
        ng serve -open
        The --open (or just -o) option automatically opens your browser to http://localhost:4200/.
